Every object in your game is an Entity, but on its own, an Entity is nothing more than a position and orientation in space. In order to give an Entity a behavior you must add Components. The PlayCanvas Engine contains built-in Components which add lots of useful behavior such as rendering a 3D model or playing audio. Using the Script Component custom behavior can be written in Javascript.

实体使用 PlayCanvas 编辑器编辑。实体层级树显示在层级树面板中。
