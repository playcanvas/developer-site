## Component Properties

| Property                | Описание |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Scroll Mode             | Specifies how the scroll view should behave when the user scrolls past the end of the content. Modes are defined as follows: <ul><li>Clamp: Content does not scroll any further than its bounds.</li><li>Bounce: Content scrolls past its bounds and then gently bounces back.</li><li>Infinite: Content can scroll forever.</li></ul> |
| Bounce                  | Controls how far the content should move before bouncing back. |
| Friction                | Controls how freely the content should move if thrown, i.e. By flicking on a phone or by flinging the scroll wheel on a mouse. A value of 1 means that content will stop immediately; 0 means that content will continue moving forever (or until the bounds of the content are reached, depending on the scroll mode). |
| Use Mouse Wheel         | Whether to use mouse wheel for scrolling (horizontally and vertically) when mouse is within bounds. |
| Mouse Wheel Sensitivity | Mouse wheel horizontal and vertical sensitivity. Only used if *Use Mouse Wheel* is set. Setting a direction to 0 will disable mouse wheel scrolling in that direction. 1 is a default sensitivity that is considered to feel good. The values can be set higher or lower than 1 to tune the sensitivity. Defaults to [1, 1]. |
| Вид                | The entity to be used as the masked viewport area, within which the content will scroll. This entity must have an ElementGroup component. |
| Content                 | The entity which contains the scrolling content itself. This entity must have an Element component. |
| Horizontal              | Whether to enable horizontal scrolling. |
| Scrollbar (horizontal)  | The entity to be used as the horizontal scrollbar. This entity must have a Scrollbar component. |
| Visibility (horizontal) | Controls whether the horizontal scrollbar should be visible all the time, or only visible when the content exceeds the size of the viewport. |
| Vertical                | Whether to enable vertical scrolling. |
| Scrollbar (vertical)    | The entity to be used as the vertical scrollbar. This entity must have a Scrollbar component. |
| Visibility (vertical)   | Controls whether the vertical scrollbar should be visible all the time, or only visible when the content exceeds the size of the viewport. |
