Every object in your game is an Entity, but on its own, an Entity is nothing more than a position and orientation in space. In order to give an Entity a behavior you must add Components. The PlayCanvas Engine contains built-in Components which add lots of useful behavior such as rendering a 3D model or playing audio. Using the Script Component custom behavior can be written in Javascript.

エンティティはPlayCanvas Editorで編集します。エンティティ階層はHierarchyパネルに表示されます。
