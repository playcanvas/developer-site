The Nodes Pane lists the built-in nodes available for constructing graphs. Nodes are organized into sub-sections by category.

At the top of the pane is a filter entry box. Use this to filter the list of nodes by name.

For more information on using the Nodes Pane to create nodes, see the [Graph Editor][1] documentation.
