If you are planning to move from a Personal Plan to an Organization, we recommend following the steps below to move your projects across to the new Organization. 

* Create the organization account and subscribe for at least one seat.
* On your account with the Personal Plan, transfer all projects ownership to the Organization account.
* On the Organization account, accept the project transfer requirements.
* Cancel the Personal Plan to downgrade to the Free plan. Please note, this will happen immediately, regardless of when you last paid.
* Add yourself to the projects as Admin on the Organization account.

All the projects will now be under the Organization account with your user account as Admin for the projects.
