Scenes contain:

* **Scene Settings** which contains properties about the scene

The **Scene Hierarchy** is a graph of [Entities][entities] that can have [Components][components] to give these Entities behaviors such as having a mesh to render in the world or to play sound effects. They can also be given custom behavior with [scripts][scripts].
