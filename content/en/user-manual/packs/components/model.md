## Properties

| Property              | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Type                  | The type of the model to be rendered. Can be: <ul><li>Asset</li><li>Box</li><li>Capsule</li><li>Cone</li><li>Cylinder</li><li>Plane</li><li>Sphere</li></ul> |
| Asset                 | The model asset rendered by this model component. Only applies to models of type 'asset'. Only a single model can be rendered per model component. |
| Cast Shadows          | If enabled, the model rendered by this component will cast shadows onto other models in the scene. |
| Cast Lightmap Shadows | If enabled, the model rendered by this component will cast shadows into lightmaps. |
| Receive Shadows       | If enabled, the model rendered by this component will receive shadows cast by other models in the scene. |
| Static                | If the model never moves, check this box as a hint to the engine to make certain optimizations. |
| Lightmapped           | If enabled, this model does not receive lighting from dynamic lights. Instead it receives lighting generated by lightmap lights. |
| Batch Group           | The Batch Group that this model belongs to. More on Batching [here][5]. |
