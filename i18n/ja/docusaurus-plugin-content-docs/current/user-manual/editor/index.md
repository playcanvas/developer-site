## 概要

The PlayCanvas Editor is a visual editing tool which you use to create and edit the [Scenes](../glossary#scene) and [Entities](../glossary#entity) that make up your project.

* ブラウザ上で実行されるため、どこでも利用できます。
* Uses the PlayCanvas [Engine](../engine) to render your scene. What you see is what you get.
* One button press to open your project in a new tab - the [Launch page](launch-page).
* ライブ編集により、実行中のゲームでもゲームを反復処理できます。
* [Real-time collaboration](realtime-collaboration) of multiple users on a single project.
* [Version control](version-control) to organize features into separate branches.

## Updates

The PlayCanvas Editor is ever changing with each update bringing in new features and deprecating old ones. To keep up, project data may have to be [migrated](migrations) to accomodate such changes. For larger and more complicated changes, you may have to adjust your project manually to ensure it is [compatible](engine-compatibility) with your current engine.

If you are having trouble applying these adjustments or notice unusual changes in your project, visit our [FAQ](faq) page.

## Customization

In rare cases you may wish to extend the functionality of the editor to add custom behavior for your particular workflow. This can be achieved by using our [Editor API](editor-api).
