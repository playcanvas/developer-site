The PlayCanvas Editor provides a complete asset management system for your project. This section covers how to work with assets in the Editor, including importing, organizing, and configuring them.

## What You'll Learn

- **[Assets Panel](asset-panel)** - Navigate and manage your project's assets using the Assets Panel
- **[Importing Assets](importing)** - Upload and import assets into your project
- **[Import Pipeline](import-pipeline/)** - Configure how assets are processed during import
- **[Asset Inspectors](inspectors/)** - Configure asset properties using the Inspector
- **[Asset Store](asset-store/)** - Browse and import assets from the PlayCanvas Asset Store
- **[Asset Viewers](viewers)** - Inspect models and textures in dedicated viewer tools

## Overview

Assets in the Editor are managed through the [Assets Panel](asset-panel), which provides a visual interface for:

- Organizing assets into folders
- Uploading new assets via drag-and-drop
- Searching and filtering assets
- Inspecting and editing asset properties
- Copying assets between projects

When you upload a file, the Editor runs it through the [import pipeline](import-pipeline/) to convert and optimize it for use in your application. The resulting asset can then be configured using the appropriate [asset inspector](inspectors/).

For conceptual information about assets and how to work with them programmatically, see the [Assets](/user-manual/assets/) section in Common Topics.
