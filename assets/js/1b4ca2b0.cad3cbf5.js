Diffuse light is light that has been absorbed, scattered in the material and re-emerged. This light tends to be uniform in direction unlike specular light. During this absorbing and re-emerging some light wavelengths will be absorbed. The wavelengths that are not absorbed give the material its color. For example, if all blue and green wavelengths are absorbed, the material will appear red. In rendering terms, diffuse color is sometimes known as "albedo" or "base color".'}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(a.h2,{id:"energy-conservation",children:"Energy Conservation"}),"\n",(0,t.jsxs)(a.p,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(a.img,{alt:"Energy Conservation",src:s(47523).A+"",width:"1300",height:"339"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(a.em,{children:"Smooth surfaces have small bright patches, rough surfaces have large dim patches"})]}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(a.p,{children:"One of the key features of physically correct rendering is that of Energy Conservation.
