Generally, when 3D content is created, individual animations are authored and these animations are typically referred to as cycles (because they loop). For example, a human character could have an idle cycle, a walk cycle, a run cycle and so on. As a PlayCanvas developer, you'll want a mechanism to play these animations back on your animated object. Additionally, you do not want these animations to 'pop' as one is switched for another. To remedy this, you should use animation blending which implements a smooth transition from one animation to another.
