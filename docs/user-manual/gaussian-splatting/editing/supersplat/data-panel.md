The Data Panel can be used to analyze the contents of your splat scenes. Initially, it is collapsed at the bottom of the application's window. To open it, click on the panel's header or press the 'D' key.

The Data Panel plots various scene properties on a histogram display. You can select splats directly by dragging on the histogram view. Use the Shift key to add to the current selection and the Ctrl key to remove from the current selection.
