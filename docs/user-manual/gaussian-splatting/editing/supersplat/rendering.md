SuperSplat enables you to render high-quality videos directly from your animated 3D Gaussian Splats. Whether you want to showcase your creations on social media, embed them on your website, or keep them locally, this guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

To render a video from your splat:

1. Open your splat in the [SuperSplat Editor](https://superspl.at/editor).
2. Set up your camera animations on the Timeline.
3. Click the `Render` menu in the menu bar and select `Video`.

## Video Settings

When you select the `Render` option, a dialog will appear with several settings to customize your video:

- **Resolution:** Choose from the following resolutions:
  - `960x540`
  - `1280x720`
  - `1920x1080`
  - `2560x1440`
  - `3840x2160`
- **Bitrate:** Adjust the quality of your video by choosing a higher or lower bitrate. Options are:
  - `Low`
  - `Medium`
  - `High`
  - `Ultra`
- **Portrait Mode:** If checked, the resolution will be flipped to be vertical. This is useful if you intend your video to be viewed in portrait on mobile.
- **Show Debug Overlays:** If checked, whatever splat visualization mode (centers or rings) is active in the Editor will be rendered to the video.

## Rendering the Video

Once you've configured your settings:

1. Click the `Rendering` button.
2. The Timeline pointer will animate through all frames until video encoding is complete.
3. On completion, your video will auto-download.

> [!IMPORTANT]
Your video is rendered entirely locally on your device. No video data or splat information is uploaded to any external server.

## Tips for Best Results

- Before rendering, ensure your Timeline animations are smooth and camera movements are polished.
- For sharing on social platforms, portrait-mode videos often yield better engagement on mobile.

Happy Rendering! ðŸŽ¬
