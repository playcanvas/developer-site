title: Gaussian Splatting
---

3D Gaussian Splatting is a revolutionary technique for capturing, representing, and rendering photorealistic 3D scenes. Unlike traditional polygonal meshes, Gaussian Splatting uses millions of small, semi-transparent elliptical splats to reconstruct detailed environments with exceptional visual fidelity.

## What Makes Gaussian Splatting Special?

Gaussian Splatting excels at capturing real-world environments through photogrammetry, making it incredibly quick and affordable to generate high-quality 3D content. The technique is particularly powerful for:

- **Photorealistic environments** - Capture real locations with stunning visual detail
- **Rapid content creation** - Generate complex 3D scenes from simple photo/video capture
- **Volumetric representation** - Handle translucent materials, fine details, and complex lighting naturally
- **Real-time rendering** - Optimized for interactive frame rates in web browsers
