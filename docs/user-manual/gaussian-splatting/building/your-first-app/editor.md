title: Using the Editor
---

Let's build a simple Gaussian splat application step by step using the [PlayCanvas Editor](/user-manual/editor). We'll create a scene with an interactive 3D toy cat splat that you can rotate around.

:::tip

The project we will be building can be found [here](https://playcanvas.com/project/1372123/overview/my-first-splat-app). Instead of building it from scratch, feel free to simply [fork it](/user-manual/editor/projects/creating/#fork-an-existing-project) instead. Or use it as a reference if you get stuck while following the steps below.

## Video Walk-Through

The complete process to build the app is in this short video:

<video autoPlay muted loop controls src='/video/my-first-splat-editor.mp4' style={{width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

Here are the actions demonstrated in the video as a set of steps you can follow:

## Creating a New Project

First, let's create a new PlayCanvas project:

1. Go to [playcanvas.com](https://playcanvas.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click **NEW** to create a new project
3. Select the **Blank Project** template
4. Enter a name like "My First Splat"
5. Click **CREATE** to create the project

PlayCanvas takes you to the new project's dashboard. Click the **EDITOR** button and the Editor opens with a ba scene.

## Preparing the Scene

Let's make some small modifications to the project to get started:

1. In the **HIERARCHY** panel, select and delete the **Light**, **Box** and **Plane** entities
2. Click the **Settings** icon (cog) in the Viewport
3. In the **INSPECTOR** panel, navigate to **SETTINGS â†’ RENDERING**:
   * Unset the **Skybox** by clicking the **x** icon (this removes the default blue sky)
   * Uncheck both **Anti-Alias** and **Device Pixel Ratio**

:::info Performance Optimization

We uncheck **Anti-Alias** and **Device Pixel Ratio** to reduce the fragment processing load, which is the primary bottleneck in Gaussian splat rendering. This helps to achieve optimal splat rendering performance. Learn more in the [Performance](../engine-features/performance.md) guide.

You should now see a clean dark gray viewport with just the Camera entity remaining in the hierarchy.

## Uploading the Splat Asset

First, download the toy cat splat to your local file system: [`https://developer.playcanvas.com/assets/toy-cat.sog`](https://developer.playcanvas.com/assets/toy-cat.sog)

Now let's add the downloaded splat to the project:

1. In the **ASSETS** panel (bottom of the screen), click the **+** icon
2. Select **Upload** from the popup menu
3. In the file open dialog, locate and select the downloaded `toy-cat.sog` and click **Open**

The Editor processes the `.sog` file and displays it in your Assets panel as a `gsplat` asset (with name `toy-cat.sog`).

## Creating the Splat Entity

Let's create an entity to display our splat:

1. Drag and drop the `toy-cat.sog` asset from the **ASSETS** panel into the Viewport.

The Editor creates a new entity under the root in the **HIERARCHY** panel and you should now see the toy cat in the viewport.

## Positioning the Splat

The splat is not centered on the origin so let's adjust its transform:

1. Select the newly created splat entity in the **HIERARCHY** panel
2. In the **INSPECTOR** panel, set **Position** to `X: 0, Y: -0.7, Z: 0`

You should now see the toy cat centered on the origin.

## Adding Camera Controls

To make the scene interactive, let's assign a script to our camera entity:

1. Right-click this link and select **Save link as...**: [`camera-controls.mjs`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playcanvas/engine/main/scripts/esm/camera-controls.mjs)
2. In the **ASSETS** panel (bottom of the screen), click the **+** icon
3. Select **Upload** from the popup menu
4. In the file open dialog, locate and select the downloaded `camera-controls.mjs` script and click **Open**

Now let's attach the script to our camera:

1. Select the **Camera** entity in the **HIERARCHY** panel
2. In the **INSPECTOR**, click **ADD COMPONENT** and select **Script**
3. In the Script component, click the **Add Script** dropdown
4. Select **cameraControls** from the list

You've now attached the camera controls script and it's ready to use!

## Testing the Scene

Now let's test our interactive splat scene:

1. Click the **LAUNCH** button in the Viewport's toolbar to run the project
2. You should see the toy cat splat displayed in your browser
3. Try interacting with it:
   - **Left mouse drag**: Orbit around the splat
   - **Mouse wheel**: Zoom in and out

## Final Result

Congratulations! You've successfully created an interactive Gaussian splat application using the PlayCanvas Editor.

:::tip Next Steps

Now that you have a working splat app, try experimenting with:

- Swapping the toy cat `.sog` file for one of your own
- Adding a user interface
- Building more complex interactions with scripts
