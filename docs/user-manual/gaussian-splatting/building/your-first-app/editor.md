title: Using the Editor
---

Let's build a simple Gaussian splat application step by step using the [PlayCanvas Editor](/user-manual/editor). We'll create a scene with an interactive 3D toy cat splat that you can rotate around.

:::tip

The project we will be building can be found [here](https://playcanvas.com/project/1372123/overview/my-first-splat-app). Instead of building it from scratch, feel free to simply [fork it](/user-manual/editor/projects/creating/#fork-an-existing-project) instead. Or use it as a reference if you get stuck while following the steps below.

## Video Walk-Through

The complete process to build the app is in this short video:

<video autoPlay muted loop controls src='/video/my-first-splat-editor.mp4' style={{width: '100%', height: 'auto'}} />

Here are the actions demonstrated in the video as a set of steps you can follow:

## Creating a New Project

First, let's create a new PlayCanvas project:

1. Go to [playcanvas.com](https://playcanvas.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click **"NEW"** to create a new project
3. Select the **"Blank Project"** template
4. Enter a name like "My First Splat"
5. Click **"CREATE"** to create the project

You will be taken to the new project's dashboard. Click the EDITOR button and the Editor will open with an empty scene containing just a camera, directional light, cube and plane.

:::warning Performance Optimization

For optimal splat rendering performance, disable anti-aliasing and device pixel ratio. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Rendering** and uncheck both **"Anti-Alias"** and **"Device Pixel Ratio"**. This helps reduce the fragment processing load, which is the primary bottleneck in Gaussian splat rendering. Learn more in the [Performance](../engine-features/performance.md) guide.

## Uploading the Splat Asset

First, download the toy cat splat to your local file system: [`https://developer.playcanvas.com/assets/toy-cat.sog`](https://developer.playcanvas.com/assets/toy-cat.sog)

Now let's add the downloaded splat to the project:

1. In the **ASSETS** panel (bottom of the screen), click the + icon
2. Select **"Upload"** from the popup menu
3. In the file open dialog, locate and select the `toy-cat.sog`

The `.sog` file will be processed and appear in your Assets panel as a `gsplat` asset.

## Creating the Splat Entity

Let's create an entity to display our splat:

1. Drag and drop the `gsplat` asset from the Asset Panel into the Viewport.

A new entity will be created under the root in the Hierarchy panel and the toy cat should now be visible in the viewport.

## Positioning the Splat

The splat is not be positioned correctly. Let's adjust its transform:

1. With the "Toy Cat" entity still selected, look at the **ENTITY** header section in the Inspector
2. Set the **Position** to `0, -0.7, 0` (centers it on the origin)

## Adding Camera Controls

To make the scene interactive, let's assign a script to our camera entity:

1. Download the [`camera-controls.mjs`](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/blob/main/scripts/esm/camera-controls.mjs) script from the PlayCanvas Engine GitHub repo
2. In the **ASSETS** panel (bottom of the screen), click the + icon
3. Select **"Upload"** from the popup menu
4. In the file open dialog, locate and select the `camera-controls.mjs` script
5. Select the uploaded script in the **ASSETS** panel and click the **PARSE** button

Now let's attach the script to our camera:

1. Select the **"Camera"** entity in the **HIERARCHY** panel
2. In the **INSPECTOR**, click **"ADD COMPONENT"** and select **"Script"**
3. In the Script component, click the **"Add Script"** dropdown
4. Select **"cameraControls"** from the list (it should appear in the dropdown now)

The camera controls script is now attached and ready to use!

## Testing the Scene

Now let's test our interactive splat scene:

1. Click the **"LAUNCH"** button in the Viewport's toolbar to run the project
2. You should see the toy cat splat displayed in your browser
3. Try interacting with it:
   - **Left mouse drag**: Orbit around the splat
   - **Mouse wheel**: Zoom in and out

## Final Result

Congratulations! You've successfully created an interactive Gaussian splat application using the PlayCanvas Editor.

:::tip Next Steps

Now that you have a working splat app, try experimenting with:

- Swapping the toy cat `.sog` file for one of your own
- Adding a user interface
- Building more complex interactions with scripts
