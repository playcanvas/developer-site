title: Custom Shaders
---

The PlayCanvas Engine supports custom shaders for Gaussian Splats, allowing you to create advanced visual effects and customize the rendering behavior beyond the standard implementation.

## Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating different custom shader techniques:

### Animation Effects

[**Simple Sinusoidal Animation**](https://playcanvas.github.io/#/gaussian-splatting/multi-splat) - Applies a simple shader to animate Gaussian color and position using a sine wave. This example demonstrates how to create dynamic, procedural motion effects by modifying splat properties in real-time.

### Transition Effects

[**3D Gaussian Splat Statues**](https://playcanvas.com/project/1224723/overview/3d-gaussian-splat-statues) - Uses custom shaders to transition splats on and off screen via a hot, plasma-type effect. This showcases how custom shaders can create dramatic visual transitions and material effects.

### Lighting and Relighting

[**3DGS with Physics and Relighting**](https://playcanvas.com/project/1358087/overview/3dgs-with-physics-and-relighting) - Uses custom shaders to relight a splat to implement a night mode with multiple moving point light sources. This example demonstrates advanced lighting techniques and how to dynamically modify splat appearance based on scene lighting conditions.
