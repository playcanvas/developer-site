The PlayCanvas Engine provides a [Picker API](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Picker.html) which can query the mesh instance rendered at a specified pixel. The picker works with splats in the same way that it does for meshes.

Check out the [Engine Splat Picking Example](https://playcanvas.github.io/#/gaussian-splatting/picking) to see how it's done.
