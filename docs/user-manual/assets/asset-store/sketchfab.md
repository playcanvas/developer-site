The Asset Store is integrated with [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/), the popular online platform for publishing, sharing, and discovering 3D, VR, and AR content. This integration gives you access to thousands of free, high-quality 3D models without having to leave the Editor.

## Logging in to Sketchfab

The first time you attempt to import a model from Sketchfab, you will be ask to either sign up or log in to Sketchfab:

![Sketchfab Authentication](/images/user-manual/assets/asset-store/sketchfab-login.png)

This will take you to `sketchfab.com` to authenticate. Once you are signed in to Sketchfab, you need to accept Sketchfab's authorization request:

You should then receive a message that you have successfully connected your Sketchfab account to PlayCanvas! ðŸŽ‰
