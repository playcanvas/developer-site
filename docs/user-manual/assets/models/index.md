3D models and animations are imported into PlayCanvas by uploading scene files from a [3D modeling application][1] such as [Blender][2], 3D Studio Max or Maya.

PlayCanvas supports a wide variety of formats, such as glTF binary (GLB), FBX, COLLADA and obj. We recommend using the GLB format for best results.

Uploading one of these files will create a [Source Asset][3] of type 'Model' and will produce several [Target Assets][4] including a '[Template]'[7] with the model hierarchy and 'Render' assets. You can add an instance of the 'Template' in your game.
