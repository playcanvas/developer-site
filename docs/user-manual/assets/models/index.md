title: Importing 3D Models
---

3D models and animations are imported into PlayCanvas by uploading scene files from a [3D modeling application](/user-manual/assets/models/building) such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), 3D Studio Max or Maya.

PlayCanvas supports a wide variety of formats, such as glTF binary (GLB), FBX, COLLADA and obj. We recommend using the GLB format for best results.

Uploading one of these files will create a [Source Asset](/user-manual/glossary#source-asset) of type 'Model' and will produce several [Target Assets](/user-manual/glossary#target-asset) including a '[Template](/user-manual/editor/assets/inspectors/template/)' with the model hierarchy and 'Render' assets. You can add an instance of the 'Template' in your game.
