# `<Environment/>`

import { CodeExample, Staging } from '@site/src/components/playcanvas-react/CodeExample';
import { Application } from '@playcanvas/react';
import { EnvironmentExample } from './environment-example';
import EnvironmentExampleSource from '!!raw-loader!./environment-example.jsx';

The `<Environment/>` component is used to configure the environment lighting and skybox for a scene. It provides a simple way to set up global lighting, and other effects that affect the entire scene.

With an `<Environment/>` component in your scene, you can:

- Set the background texture for the scene
- Provides Image-Based Lighting (IBL) for realistic environmental reflections
- Controls sky dome properties, rotation, scale, and positioning
- Manages exposure, luminance, and other global lighting parameters

## Usage

Place the `<Environment/>` component within an [`<Application/>`](../application) and add it to the scene. You'll need to load a HDR or environment atlas and provide it to the component.

:::tip

**You only need one `<Environment/>` component for the entire scene**. Using multiple `<Environment/>` components within the same `<Application/>` will trigger a warning.

:::

Simply load a HDR and set it as the skybox. You can find great HDR images on [HDRI Haven](https://hdrihaven.com/).

```jsx copy
const EnvironmentExample = () => {
  const { asset: skybox } = useTexture('/env.hdr')

  return (
      <Environment skybox={skybox} />
      {/* The rest of your scene... */}
  )
}
```

The component will affect the entire scene, so you should only use it once. You can specify global lighting parameters like exposure, luminance, and other global lighting parameters. See the [Properties](#properties) section for more details.

You can also use the `<Environment/>` component to create a dome effect. This is useful for creating a more realistic environment with a ground plane. You can specify the scale, position, rotation, and other properties of the dome.
