description: Documentation for the Environment component

The `Environment` component is used to configure the environment lighting and skybox for a scene. It provides a comprehensive way to set up atmospheric lighting, skyboxes, and environmental effects that affect the entire scene.

## Overview

The Environment component combines several PlayCanvas scene and sky properties into a single, easy-to-use component:

- **Skybox**: Sets the background texture for the scene
- **Environment Atlas**: Provides Image-Based Lighting (IBL) for realistic environmental reflections
- **Sky Settings**: Controls sky dome properties, rotation, scale, and positioning
- **Scene Settings**: Manages exposure, luminance, and other global lighting parameters

## Usage

The Environment component should be placed within an `<Application>` component. Only one Environment component should be used per application instance.

```jsx copy
import { Environment } from '@playcanvas/react/components'
import { useEnvAtlas } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'

const EnvironmentExample = () => {
  const { asset: envAtlas } = useEnvAtlas('/env_atlas.png')

  return (
    <Application>
      <Environment 
        envAtlas={envAtlas}
        exposure={1.2}
        showSkybox={false}
      />
      {/* Your scene entities here */}
    </Application>
  )
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Single Instance**: Only one `<Environment/>` component should be used per application instance
- **Asset Requirements**: The `skybox` and `envAtlas` props expect PlayCanvas Asset instances, typically loaded using hooks
- **Automatic Cleanup**: The component automatically restores default values when unmounted

## Properties

```tsx asTypedoc
import { Environment } from '@playcanvas/react/components'
type $ = React.ComponentProps<typeof Environment>;
export default $;
```
