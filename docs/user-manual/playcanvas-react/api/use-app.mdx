# useApp

The `useApp` hook provides access to the PlayCanvas [Application](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Application.html) instance from within your React components. It's a convenient way to get information about the app state, fire events or more.

```jsx copy title="./my-component.jsx" copy
import { useApp } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'

function MyComponent() {
  const app = useApp()
  
  // Access application properties
  console.log('Scene:', app.scene)
  console.log('Camera:', app.scene.camera)
  
  return null
}
```

A reference to the app gives you access to the scene, camera, systems, etc.

## Application context

The hook only makes relies on the `<Application/>` component for context, so without one it will throw an error. Call it from inside a component that is a child of an `<Application/>`.

```jsx title="ðŸš« No <Application> context"
// Nope, useApp is outside <Application>
export const Wrong = () => {
  const app = useApp();
  return (
    <Application>
      <Scene/>
    </Application>
  )
}
```

```jsx copy title="âœ… Correct <Application> context"
// Yep! `useApp` has <Application> context
const Correct = () => {
  const app = useApp();
  return <Scene />;
}

export const App = () => <Application>
  <Correct/>
  </Application>
```
