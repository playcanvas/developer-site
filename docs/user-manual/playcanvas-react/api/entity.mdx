# `<Entity/>`

The `<Entity/>` component is the fundamental building block of a React application. It represents a node in the scene graph hierarchy and can contain other entities as children, as well as components that define its behavior and appearance.

```jsx copy
import { Entity } from '@playcanvas/react'

export default function Scene() {
  return (
    <Entity>
      <Entity name="child" />
      <Entity name="other-child">
        <Entity name="nested-child" />
      </Entity>
    </Entity>
  )
}
```

An `<Entity/>` is a transform node, which has position, rotation and scale. On its own, it has no behavior. To allow it to render something, react to physics or behave like a camera you must add behavior using components.

:::tip

An `<Entity/>` on its own has no behavior. You can add Components to an `<Entity/>` to give it behavior. Components are the building blocks of behavior in PlayCanvas.
