The `Entity` component is the fundamental building block in PlayCanvas React applications. It represents a node in the scene graph hierarchy and can contain other entities as children, as well as components that define its behavior and appearance.

```jsx copy
import { Entity } from '@playcanvas/react'

export default function Scene() {
  return (
    <Entity>
      <Entity name="child" />
      <Entity name="other-child">
        <Entity name="nested-child" />
      </Entity>
    </Entity>
  )
}
```

Entities on their own are not visible, they need components to have behavior. You can add components to an entity by nesting them within the `Entity` component.

## Properties

```tsx asTypedoc
import { Entity } from '@playcanvas/react'
type $ = React.ComponentProps<typeof Entity>;
export default $;
```
