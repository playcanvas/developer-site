# `<Script/>`

import { CodeExample, Staging } from '@site/src/components/playcanvas-react/CodeExample';
import { Application } from '@playcanvas/react';
import { ScriptExample } from './script-example';
import ScriptExampleSource from '!!raw-loader!./script-example.jsx';

The `<Script/>` component provides a simple imperative way to add behaviors to an [`<Entity/>`](../entity).

This is useful for things like [physics](../../guide/physics), animation, and [interactivity](../../guide/interactivity) where, for performance reasons, you want to bypass updating React props. It allows you to hook into the engine's update loop outside of React, which is useful for performance-critical code. You can also leverage existing Scripts from PlayCanvas Editor Projects.

You can find more information about [Scripts](/user-manual/scripting/) in the Engine documentation.

## Usage

The `Script` component takes a class that extends the PlayCanvas [Script](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Script.html) class and attaches it to the `Entity`. Any additional props are passed to the Script class directly and can be used as properties on the class.

```tsx
import { Script } from '@playcanvas/react/components'
import { CameraControls } from 'playcanvas/scripts/esm/camera-controls.mjs'

return <Script script={CameraControls} />
```

The following examples adds a `SpinMe` script to the entity that rotates the entity every frame.

<CodeExample
  label="Script component with rotation behavior"
  code={ScriptExampleSource}
  showDemo
>
  <Application>
    <Staging
      useLight={true}
      useShadow={true}
      useGrid={true}
      camera={[3, 3, 3]}
      useControls={true}
    >
      <ScriptExample />
    </Staging>
  </Application>
</CodeExample>

You can use any existing Script or create your own, or any from the engine repository for [existing Scripts](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/tree/main/scripts/esm).

:::tip
The PlayCanvas engine contains a number of useful scripts that you can use in your projects. **Find them [here](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/tree/main/scripts/esm)**.

You can learn more about the anatomy of a ESM Script in the [Scripting documentation](/user-manual/scripting/fundamentals/esm-scripts).

## Properties

```tsx asTypedoc
import { Script as PcScript } from 'playcanvas'
type SubclassOf<T> = new (...args: any[]) => T;
type $ = {
  /**
   * The Script class to attach to the entity
   */
  script: SubclassOf<PcScript>;
  /**
   * Additional props that will be passed to the script instance as attributes
   */
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
export default $;
```
