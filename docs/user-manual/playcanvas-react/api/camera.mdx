# `<Camera/>`

import { CodeExample, Staging } from '@site/src/components/playcanvas-react/CodeExample';
import { Application } from '@playcanvas/react';
import { CameraExample } from './camera-example';
import CameraExampleSource from '!!raw-loader!./camera-example.jsx';

Without a camera in your scene, nothing will be rendered. The `<Camera/>` component enables an [`<Entity/>`](../entity) to render a scene from it's perspective. The entity's position and rotation to control the cameras viewpoint.

## Usage

Attach a `<Camera/>` to an [`<Entity/>`](../entity) and it will render the scene from the entity's position and rotation.

```tsx
<Entity>
  <Camera clearColor="red" />
</Entity>
```

In this example we're switching between 2 different cameras in the scene, each with it's own properties.

<CodeExample
  label="Switch between camera types"
  code={CameraExampleSource}
  showDemo
>
  <Application>
    <Staging
      useLight={true}
      useShadow={true}
      useGrid={true}
      useCamera={false}
    >
      <CameraExample />
    </Staging>
  </Application>
</CodeExample>
