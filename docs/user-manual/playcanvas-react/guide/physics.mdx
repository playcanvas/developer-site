PlayCanvas ships with a [physics system](/user-manual/physics/). This enables realistic simulations of objects in 3D space, including gravity, collisions, forces, and constraints. The physics system is powered by the [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) physics engine.

:::tip

Make sure you have `sync-ammo` installed and `usePhysics` enabled on your Application component to use physics.

:::

You allow entities to participate in physics simulation by adding a `RigidBody` and `Collision` component to them. In the example below, we're creating a static ground, a falling sphere, and a falling box.

<CodeExample 
  label="Objects falling under gravity" 
  filename="basic-physics.jsx" 
  code={BasicPhysicsSource} 
  showDemo
>
    <Application usePhysics>
      <Staging useControls={true}>
        <BasicPhysics />
      </Staging>
    </Application>
</CodeExample>

### Physics Properties

You can customize physics behavior by changing the various properties of the `RigidBody` and `Collision` components. Check out the [Physics documentation](/user-manual/physics/) for more information.

```jsx
<RigidBody 
  type="dynamic"
  mass={1}                // Object mass
  linearDamping={0.1}     // Air resistance for movement
  angularDamping={0.1}    // Air resistance for rotation
  friction={0.5}          // Surface friction
  restitution={0.3}       // Bounciness (0 = no bounce, 1 = perfect bounce)
/>
```

```jsx
<Collision 
  type="box"
  halfExtents={[1, 1, 1]} // Size for box collision
  radius={0.5}            // Radius for sphere/cylinder collision
  height={2}              // Height for capsule/cylinder collision
/>
```

## Using the usePhysics Hook

The physics engine is lazily loaded and instantiated. This prioritises the first render of your application, allowing you to display something as soon as possible. This is great for performance, but you'll need to check the physics state to ensure it's loaded before you can use it.

The `usePhysics` hook provides information about the physics engine state:

```jsx
import { usePhysics } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks';

const PhysicsStatus = () => {
  const { isPhysicsEnabled, isPhysicsLoaded, physicsError } = usePhysics();

  if (physicsError) {
    return <div>Physics error: {physicsError.message}</div>;
  }

  if (!isPhysicsLoaded) {
    return <div>Loading physics...</div>;
  }

  return <div>Physics is ready!</div>;
};
```
