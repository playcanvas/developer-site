# Working with Materials

import { CodeExample, Staging } from '@site/src/components/playcanvas-react/CodeExample';
import { Application } from '@playcanvas/react';
import { Materials } from './components/materials';
import MaterialsSource from '!!raw-loader!./components/materials.jsx';

Materials are a fundamental part of 3D graphics. They define the appearance of 3D objects and are used to create realistic lighting effects. Materials can be applied to `Render` components to change the appearance of 3D objects. They accept a wide range of properties to control the appearance of the material.

The `useMaterial` hook returns a [`StandardMaterial`](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/StandardMaterial.html) instance. This is useful if you need to create materials and apply them to `Render` components.

```jsx copy filename="use-material.jsx"
import { useMaterial } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'

const RedBox = () => {
  const material = useMaterial({ diffuse: 'red' });
  return (
    <Entity>
      <Render type="box" material={material} />
    </Entity>
  )
}
```

In the example below, we're using the `useMaterial` hook to create a material and applying it to a `Render` component. We also add a `onClick` event to the `Entity` to change the material properties when the cube is clicked.

<CodeExample label="Click the cube to change the materials properties" filename="materials.jsx" code={MaterialsSource} showDemo>
    <Application usePhysics>
        <Staging useControls={true} camera={[3, 2, 3]} useGrid={true}>
            <Materials />
        </Staging>
    </Application>
</CodeExample>

Materials have a wide range of properties that can be used to control the appearance of the material. You can find the full list of properties [here](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/StandardMaterial.html).
