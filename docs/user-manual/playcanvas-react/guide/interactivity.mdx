Once you have a scene, you'll want to make it interactive. You can do this in a number of ways depending on your use case.

### Pointer Events

You can attach pointer events to an `Entity` to respond to user interaction. It's a simple way to handle user input in a reactive way.

:::tip

Pointer events bubble up. You can attach events to a parent `Entity` and events will propagate up through the React tree.

Let's make a sphere that changes color when you click it.

<CodeExample label="Using pointer events" filename="interactivity.jsx" code={InteractivitySource} showDemo>
    <Application>
        <Staging>
            <InteractivityExample />
        </Staging>
    </Application>
</CodeExample>

Entities support the following pointer events which closely match the behavior of the DOM Pointer Events API.

- `onPointerUp`
- `onPointerDown`
- `onPointerOver`
- `onPointerOut`
- `onClick`

### The `Script` component

The `Script` component is a handy way to add custom behavior to an `Entity`. It's a convenient way to attach any ESM PlayCanvas [Script](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Script.html) to an `Entity`. This is useful for interactivity or animations or anything that needs to happen outside the React render loop.

You assign an ESM PlayCanvas [Script](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Script.html) to the `script` prop of a `<Script>` component.

<CodeExample label="Rotating a cube with a Script" filename="scripting.jsx" code={ScriptingSource} showDemo>
    <Application>
        <Staging>
            <ScriptingExample />
        </Staging>
    </Application>
</CodeExample>

PlayCanvas Scripts are ESM modules that extend the `Script` class. You can use any existing Script or create your own, or any from the engine repository for [existing Scripts](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/tree/main/scripts/esm).

:::tip

If you need to animate something every frame, using a `<Script>` component is generally more performant than re-rendering the React tree, however a Script can override Entity props.

You can read more about [Scripts in the docs](/user-manual/scripting/).

### Application events

A more React-y way to handle interactivity is to use the `useAppEvent` hook. This hook allows you to subscribe to PlayCanvas application events with proper TypeScript support. It supports both built-in events and custom events with their specific callback signatures.

The following example hooks into the `update` event using the `useAppEvent` and rotates the capsule.

<CodeExample label="Rotating a capsule using useAppEvent" filename="app-events.jsx" code={AppEventsSource} showDemo>
    <Application>
        <Staging>
            <AppEventsExample />
        </Staging>
    </Application>
</CodeExample>

There are various application events that you can hook into, each with a specific callback signature. It's worth checking the [Engine Application API](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/Application.html) to see what events are available. 

You can also fire your own events using the `app.fire` method.

```jsx
import { useAppEvent } from '@playcanvas/react/hooks'

const MyComponent = () => {
  useAppEvent('myEvent', (message) => {
    console.log('My event fired.', message);
  });
}

app.fire('myEvent', 'Hello, world!');
```
