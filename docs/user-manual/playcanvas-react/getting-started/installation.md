# Installation

The recommended way to get started is to use the official PlayCanvas scaffolding tool, and follow the prompts

```bash
npx create playcanvas@latest -t react-ts
```

:::note

We're working on adding more react templates, but only have typescript for now

:::

If you've followed the prompts, you'll have a new PlayCanvas react project running in your browser. We recommend following [this guide](./your-first-scene) to start building your first project.

## Manual Installation

If you have an existing project, just install `@playcanvas/react` using your preferred package manager.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install @playcanvas/react playcanvas
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @playcanvas/react playcanvas
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add @playcanvas/react playcanvas
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once installed, you can start using it in your project. As the next step, we recommend following the [getting started guide](./your-first-scene) to create your first project.
