title: Getting Started
---

Welcome to PlayCanvas React! This section will guide you through setting up your first 3D React application and teach you the fundamental concepts you need to build interactive 3D experiences.

## What You'll Learn

In this getting started guide, you'll learn how to:

- [Install and set up](./installation) PlayCanvas React in your project
- [Create your first 3D scene](../building-a-scene) with cameras, entities, and 3D models
- [Load and manage 3D assets](../guide/loading-assets) efficiently in your application

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) installed on your system
- Basic familiarity with **React** - if you're new to React, check out the [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn)
- A text editor or IDE (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is with our scaffolding tool:

```bash
npm create playcanvas@latest -t react-ts
```

This creates a new project with everything set up and ready to go. You can also try our [online playground](https://playcanvas-react.vercel.app/new) to experiment without installing anything locally.

## Next Steps

Ready to dive in? Start with the [installation guide](./installation) to set up your development environment, then follow the [building a scene](../building-a-scene) tutorial to build your first 3D application.
