Animation assets are the animation keyframe data thatâ€™s used to drive animations of a model in PlayCanvas. They are linked to an animstategraph asset via an entity's anim component.

The anim component currently supports animation assets that have been imported into a PlayCanvas project from .FBX files using the `Convert to GLB` asset tasks settings option.
