## Getting started with Zappar

Zappar provides a [Getting Started with PlayCanvas](https://docs.zap.works/universal-ar/playcanvas/getting-started/) page, and they also provide a number of [Starter Projects](https://playcanvas.com/user/zappar) to help new users get started, as well as template projects to get users up and running faster.

To get started with Zappar’s Universal AR SDK, first head to their [Zappar Universal AR Project](https://playcanvas.com/project/797342/overview/instant-tracking--particles) and fork it.

Once there, add one of the Tracking Templates provided. Zappar provides:

- Face Tracking
- Image Tracking
- Instant Tracking

Drag any of these into your scene, ensure there are no other cameras and you are ready to go! If necessary, tweak the attributes of the script attached to the template camera:
