title: Button
---

The Button Component is a convenient shortcut for creating User Interface buttons for use with [Screen][1] and [Element][2] Components.

The Button Component can be used in two Transition Modes. *Sprite Swap*, which uses a different sprite or frame for each button state or *Tint*, which tints a single sprite with a different color for each state.

## Common Properties
