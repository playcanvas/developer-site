title: Element
---

An Element component when in a hierarchy with a Screen Component ancestor is used to build user interfaces made up of 2D components such as images and text. The Element provides layout properties such as anchors and a pivot point.

See the [User Interface][1] section for more details.

## Group Element

The group element provides just the layout properties of the Element component

## Image Element

The image element displays an image using a texture asset or a solid color.

## Text Element

The text element renders a string of text using a [font asset][4].

## Common Component Properties

| Property    | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Type        | The type of Element: Group, Image or Text. |
| Preset      | Choosing a layout preset will automatically set the Anchor and Pivot properties to a preset value. |
| Anchor      | Determine where the element calculates its position in relation to. See the [Elements#Anchor][6] section for more information. |
| Pivot       | Determine where the pivot point of the Element is. (0, 0) is bottom left, (1, 1) is top right. See the [Elements#Pivot][7] section for more information. |
| Size        | The width and height of the Element. This may be automatically calculated depending on other settings. |
| Margin      | The distance from the edge of the element to the Anchor. This is only available when the Anchor is split (non-equal in one axis). |
| Use Input   | If enabled, this Element is added to the list of elements that check for input and fire input related events. |
| Layers      | The Layers to render this element into. More on Layers [here][8]. |
| Batch Group | The Batch Group that this model belongs to. More on Batching [here][9]. |

## Image Component Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Rect     | Define the area of the texture asset to display. |
| Mask     | Switch Image Element into a mask. Masks do not render into the scene, but instead limit child elements to only be rendered where this element is rendered. |
| Texture  | The texture asset displayed. |
| Color    | The color to tint the element. |
| Opacity  | The transparency of the element. |

## Text Component Properties

| Property    | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Alignment   | Determine how the text is aligned with in the element. (0, 0) is bottom left, (1, 1) is top right. |
| Text        | The text string to display. |
| Font Size   | The size in Screen component pixels to render the font at. |
| Line Height | The size in Screen component pixels to move down for a new line. |
| Spacing     | A multiplier to apply to the amount advanced between each character. |
| Font        | The font asset. |
| Color       | The color to tint the font. |
| Opacity     | The transparency of the element. |
| Wrap Lines  | Enable text wrapping. Any text that overflows the width of the text element will be wrapped to the next line. |
