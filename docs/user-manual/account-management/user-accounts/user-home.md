title: User Home

Once you have created your user account, you can visit your User Home page. The URL for this page will be of the form:

```none
https://playcanvas.com/user/<USERNAME>
```

Assuming you are logged in, simply visiting [https://playcanvas.com/](https://playcanvas.com/) will redirect you to your User Home page.

Here's what a new User Home page should look like:

![User Home Page](/img/user-manual/account-management/user-accounts/user-home.png)

It defaults to showing your list of [Editor Projects](../../editor/projects/index.md).
