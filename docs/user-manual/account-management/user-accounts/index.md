Your user account is your personal space within PlayCanvas. This section covers creating, managing and configuring your account.

## Why Create a PlayCanvas User Account?

Creating a free PlayCanvas account opens up a world of possibilities for building 3D web applications! Once you are signed up, you can:

- 🛠️ **Access the [PlayCanvas Editor](../../editor/)** - Build 3D apps using a powerful, visual interface.

But not everyone opts to use the PlayCanvas Editor - perhaps you prefer to use the [PlayCanvas Engine](../../engine/) directly, or [PlayCanvas Web Components](../../web-components/) or [PlayCanvas React](../../react/) instead. Does it still make sense to create a PlayCanvas account? Absolutely! And here's why:

- 🔍 **Explore and learn** - Browse scripts and assets in thousands of public Editor projects to learn and find inspiration
- ⚙️ **Generate Assets** - Use the Editor's asset processing capabilities to generate assets for use in any PlayCanvas-based project
- ✨ **Publish Gaussian Splats** - Upload and share your splats using [SuperSplat](https://playcanvas.com/products/supersplat)
- 👥 **Community participation** - Star, follow and comment on the projects of other PlayCanvas community members
- 🔔 **Stay Informed** - Creating an account allows us to notify you of exciting updates related to the entire PlayCanvas platform

So no matter how you use PlayCanvas, we strongly recommend you create an account on playcanvas.com!
