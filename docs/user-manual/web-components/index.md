The PlayCanvas Engine Web Components are a powerful set of custom HTML elements that make it incredibly easy to embed interactive 3D content directly into your web pages. Built on modern web standards, these components bridge the gap between traditional web development and 3D graphics, allowing you to create immersive experiences with simple HTML markup.

## What Are Web Components?

[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) are reusable custom HTML elements that encapsulate complex functionality behind a simple, declarative interface. PlayCanvas Web Components wrap the full power of the [PlayCanvas Engine](../engine/index.md) in easy-to-use HTML tags, making 3D development accessible to web developers of all skill levels.

```html
<!-- Create a 3D scene with just HTML -->
<pc-app>
  <pc-scene>
    <pc-entity name="camera" position="0 0 3">
      <pc-camera></pc-camera>
    </pc-entity>
    <pc-entity name="light" rotation="45 45 0">
      <pc-light></pc-light>
    </pc-entity>
    <pc-entity name="ball">
      <pc-render type="sphere"></pc-render>
    </pc-entity>
