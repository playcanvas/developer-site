The PlayCanvas Engine is the run-time framework that powers your PlayCanvas applications. It is written in JavaScript and is open sourced under an MIT license on [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine). It is published on the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playcanvas) and ships with full TypeScript declarations. It also comes with a comprehensive set of [code examples](https://playcanvas.github.io/).

As a developer, you have complete freedom as to how you use the Engine. The two options are:

1. Build applications against the Engine directly. [Learn](standalone) how to use the Engine standalone.
2. Build applications in the [Editor](../editor). In this case, consult the [Scripting](../scripting) section.
