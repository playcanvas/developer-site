The PlayCanvas Engine is the run-time framework that powers your PlayCanvas applications. It is written in JavaScript and is open sourced under an MIT license on [GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine).

As a developer, you have complete freedom as to how you use the Engine. The two options are:

1. Build applications against the Engine directly. [Learn](standalone.md) how to use the Engine standalone.
2. Build applications in the [Editor](../editor/index.md). In this case, consult the [Scripting](../scripting/index.md) section.
