## Settings

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Assets** | JSON assets that contain localization data. Assets in this list are automatically parsed for localization data when loaded. These are used to localize your text elements. |
| **Create New Asset** | Creates a new localization JSON asset with the default en-US format. |

### Notes

- Localization assets typically contain key-value pairs for translations.
- Switching languages at runtime requires code to update UI and scene content.
