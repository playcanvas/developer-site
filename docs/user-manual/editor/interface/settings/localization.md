Manages the JSON files for supporting multiple languages.

## Settings

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Assets** | Add existing localization JSON assets to the project. They will be parsed automatically when loaded. |
| **Create New Asset** | Create a new localization asset (default format `en-US`). |

### Notes

- Localization assets typically contain key-value pairs for translations.
- Switching languages at runtime requires code to update UI and scene content.
