By default, the Editor is configured with settings that should suit the majority of users. However, in some circumstances, you may wish to modify the default behavior of the Editor.

:::note

These settings affect only you and are global for the whole project. They are 'sticky' and persist over multiple sessions.

Navigate to the `EDITOR` section and expand the panel:
