By default, the Editor is configured with settings that should suit the majority of users. However, in some circumstances, you may wish to modify the default behavior of the Editor.

:::note

These settings affect only you and are global for the whole project. They are 'sticky' and persist over multiple sessions.

In Settings, navigate to the `EDITOR` section:

![Editor Settings](/img/user-manual/editor/interface/preferences.webp)

Here is a breakdown of the available settings:

| Setting                          | Description |

| **Snap**                         | Sets the snap increment when using the [gizmos](../viewport#gizmos) in the [Viewport](../viewport). Useful for precise positioning. |
| **Zoom Sensitivity**             | Adjusts the sensitivity of zooming in the [Viewport](../viewport). |
| **Camera Depth Grabpass**        | Configures the camera to capture depth information for special effects. |
| **Camera Color Grabpass**        | Configures the camera to capture color information for special effects. |

| **Rename Duplicated Entities**   | If enabled, duplicated entity names get an incremental number added to the end. This helps to ensure unique naming of entities. |
| **Lightmapper Auto Bake**        | Controls whether the [runtime lightmapper](/user-manual/graphics/lighting/runtime-lightmaps) automatically rebakes lightmaps whenever the scene is updated. |
