title: Project Settings
---

Project Settings control how your project runs and how the Editor behaves for your team. They include engine/runtime configuration (rendering, physics, input, network), asset import defaults, and Editor preferences. Some settings apply only to you (session or user-specific), while most affect all collaborators on the current branch.

## Opening Settings

Load the Settings into the [Inspector](../inspector) by clicking the 'cog' icon on the [Toolbar](../toolbar) or in the [Viewport](../viewport).

## Settings Overview

Settings are grouped into categories, where each category is shown as a collapsible panel. These categories are listed in the Inspector in the following order:

| Panel | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Engine](engine.md) | Engine settings, including the engine version. |
| [Editor](editor.md) | Editor settings such as camera near/far clip, zoom sensitivity, and more. |
| [Asset Import](asset-import.md) | Settings for controlling how assets are imported into your project. |
| [Physics](physics.md) | Physics settings to include the library and set gravity. |
| [Rendering](rendering.md) | Rendering settings such as skybox, clustered lighting, shadow settings, and more. |
| [Layers](layers.md) | Manage rendering layers and their order. |
| [Lightmapping](lightmapping.md) | Lightmapping settings such as resolution, mode, and ambient bake. |
| [Batch Groups](batch-groups.md) | Manage batch groups for this project. Batch groups reduce draw calls by batching similar models and elements together. |

| [Input](input.md) | Enable or disable input devices (mouse, keyboard, etc.). |
| [Localization](localization.md) | Settings for adding localization assets. |
