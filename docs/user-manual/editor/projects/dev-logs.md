Development Logs (or Dev Logs for short) are a powerful feature for communicating project updates, milestones, and news with your team and community. They help track progress and keep stakeholders informed about your project's development.

## Understanding Dev Logs

### What are Dev Logs?

Development logs are project-specific news posts that allow you to:

- Share project updates and milestones
- Communicate with team members and followers
- Document development progress
- Build community around your project
- Showcase new features and improvements

### Where Dev Logs Appear

Dev logs are displayed in two locations:

- **Project Dashboard Overview**: Chronological list of posts related to your project
- [**The Global Feed**](https://playcanvas.com/feed): Chronological list of all posts published by the entire community

## Writing Your First Dev Log

To create a development log post:

1. Navigate to your Project Dashboard
2. Go to the **OVERVIEW** section
3. In the center of the page, you will see the **DEV LOG FEED** section
4. Click in the text box showing the text **What changes hae you made today?**
5. Add your title and content
6. Click **PREVIEW** to see how your post will appear when it is published
7. Click **POST** to finally share your update

When you create a new project, you are initially blocked from posting to your Dev Log. You must first publish a build of your application before you can post.

Dev Log posts support both [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [Emoji](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/). Consider leveraging both to make your posts more engaging!
