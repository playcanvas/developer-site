## User Permissions

PlayCanvas projects support four permission levels: **Read**, **Write** and **Admin**.

### Changing Permissions

To modify a team member's permissions:

1. Go to Project **SETTINGS** > **Team**
2. Find the user in the team list
3. Click on their current permission level
4. Select the new permission level
5. Confirm the change by clicking **SAVE**

## Removing Team Members

To remove someone from your project:

1. Go to Project **SETTINGS** > **Team**
2. Find the user you want to remove
3. Mouse over the tick icon and it will switch to an **X** - click it

## Organization Team Management

### Organization Projects

If your project belongs to an organization, team management works slightly differently:

#### Organization Administrators

- Can add themselves to any organization project
- Can manage project teams across the organization
- Can access billing and seat management

#### Seat Management

For organization accounts with seat limits:

- Each team member on a private project occupies a seat
- Public projects don't require seats
- Organization owners can manage seat allocation
- Removing users from projects frees up seats

### Adding Organization Members

Organization administrators can add themselves to projects:

1. Go to the organization account page
2. Find the project in the projects list
3. Click the dropdown arrow
4. Select "Add me as admin"
