title: Working with Scenes
---

A **Scene** is the foundation of your PlayCanvas application. It defines the 3D world that users will experience, containing all the entities, components and settings that make up your game or interactive experience.

## What's in a Scene?

Every scene contains:

- **Entities** - The objects in your scene, organized in a hierarchy. Entities can represent characters, props, lights, cameras or any other element.
- **Components** - The building blocks that give entities their behavior and appearance. Components handle rendering, physics, audio, user interface and more.
- **Scene Settings** - Global properties that affect the entire scene, such as physics gravity, ambient lighting, fog and skybox.
