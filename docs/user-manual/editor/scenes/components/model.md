:::warning

The Model component is deprecated. It has been replaced by the [Render](render.md) component.

:::

The Model component enables an entity to render a primitive shape or a model asset.

The Model component can be enabled or disabled using the toggle in the top right of the component panel. If enabled, the model will be added to the scene and rendered.

## Properties

| Property                  | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Type                      | The type of the model to be rendered. Can be: Asset, Box, Capsule, Cone, Cylinder, Plane, Sphere. |
| Model                     | Asset type only. The model asset rendered by this model component. Only a single model can be rendered per model component. |
| Material                  | Primitive types only. The material asset used to render the primitive shape. |
| Cast Shadows              | If enabled, the model rendered by this component will cast shadows onto other models in the scene. |
| Cast Lightmap Shadows     | If enabled, the model rendered by this component will cast shadows into lightmaps. |
| Receive Shadows           | If enabled, the model rendered by this component will receive shadows cast by other models in the scene. |
| Static                    | If the model never moves, check this box as a hint to the engine to make certain optimizations. |
| Lightmapped               | If enabled, this model does not receive lighting from dynamic lights. Instead it receives lighting generated by lightmap lights. |
| Lightmap Size Multiplier  | A multiplier applied to the calculated lightmap size for this model. Increase for higher resolution lightmaps. Only shown when Lightmapped is enabled. |
| Custom AABB               | If enabled, allows specifying a custom axis-aligned bounding box for visibility culling instead of using the automatically calculated one. |
| AABB Center               | The center position of the custom bounding box. Only shown when Custom AABB is enabled. |
| AABB Half Extents         | The half-extents (half width, height, depth) of the custom bounding box. Only shown when Custom AABB is enabled. |
| Batch Group               | The Batch Group that this model belongs to. More on Batching [here](/user-manual/graphics/advanced-rendering/batching). |
| Layers                    | The layers to render this model into. |

## Scripting Interface

You can control a Model component's properties using a [script component](script.md). The Model component's scripting interface is [here](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/ModelComponent.html).

## Customizing Materials

You can learn how to customize the materials of your model [here](/user-manual/assets/types/material/#assigning-materials).
