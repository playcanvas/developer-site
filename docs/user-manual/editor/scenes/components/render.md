title: Render

The Render component enables an entity to render a primitive shape or a render asset.

The Render component can be enabled or disabled using the toggle in the top right of the component panel. If enabled, the mesh instances referenced by the component will be added to the scene and rendered.

## Properties

| Property                 | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Type                     | The type of the graphical object to be rendered. Can be: Asset, Box, Capsule, Cone, Cylinder, Plane, Sphere. |
| Asset                    | Asset type only. The render asset to be rendered by this render component. Only a single render asset can be assigned to a render component. |
| Root Bone                | Asset type only (skinned meshes). The entity to be used as the root bone for any skinned meshes that are rendered by this component. |
| Cast Shadows             | If enabled, the mesh instances rendered by this component will cast shadows onto other mesh instances in the scene. |
| Cast Lightmap Shadows    | If enabled, the mesh instances rendered by this component will cast shadows into lightmaps. |
| Receive Shadows          | If enabled, the mesh instances rendered by this component will receive shadows cast by other mesh instances in the scene. |
| Static                   | If the entity referencing this render component never moves, check this box as a hint to the engine to make certain optimizations. |
| Lightmapped              | If enabled, this component's mesh instances do not receive lighting from dynamic lights. Instead they receive lighting generated by lightmap-baking lights. |
| Lightmap Size Multiplier | A multiplier applied to the calculated lightmap size for this mesh. Increase for higher resolution lightmaps. Only shown when Lightmapped is enabled. |
| Custom AABB              | If enabled, allows specifying a custom axis-aligned bounding box for visibility culling instead of using the automatically calculated one. This is an optimization for skinned characters to avoid per-frame bounding box computations based on bone positions. |
| AABB Center              | The center position of the custom bounding box. Only shown when Custom AABB is enabled. |
| AABB Half Extents        | The half-extents (half width, height, depth) of the custom bounding box. Only shown when Custom AABB is enabled. |
| Batch Group              | The batch group that this component's mesh instances belong to. |
| Layers                   | The layers to render this component's mesh instances into. |
| Materials                | The material assets that will be used to render the mesh instances of this component. Each material corresponds to the respective mesh instance. |

## Scripting Interface

You can control a Render component's properties using a [script component](/user-manual/editor/scenes/components/script). The Render component's scripting interface is [here](https://api.playcanvas.com/engine/classes/RenderComponent.html).
