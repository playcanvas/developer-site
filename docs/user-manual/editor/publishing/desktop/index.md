It is possible to convert your PlayCanvas app to a native executable for each of the major desktop operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. To do this, we recommend using [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/). Instructions for generating the executable can be found on the [NW.js Wiki](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/How-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps).
