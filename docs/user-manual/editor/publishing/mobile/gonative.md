[GoNative][gonative] is a paid third party service that can take a URL and create a native mobile application that uses a native WebView to run on mobile in a few clicks.

As it is using a WebView, the user has to be online to use the app and you will have to host your PlayCanvas application somewhere such as [AWS Web Hosting services][aws-webhost].

GoNative also provides simple integration of mobile native plugins that can be accessed from your PlayCanvas application such as Google AdMob and In-App Purchases. A full list of [plugins can be found here][plugin-list].
