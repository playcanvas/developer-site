The PlayCanvas Editor provides a tightly integrated environment for writing and managing scripts. This section covers the Editor-specific tools and workflows that will enhance your scripting experience.

:::tip Learn the Basics First
If you're new to scripting in PlayCanvas, we recommend starting with the [Scripting](/user-manual/scripting/) section to learn the fundamentals—script lifecycle, events, attributes, and the Engine API—before diving into the Editor-specific features covered here.

## What the Editor Provides

As an Editor user, you benefit from a tightly integrated development environment:

- **Asset Management** — Scripts are assets, managed alongside your models, textures, and materials in the Assets panel.
- **Visual Configuration** — Script Attributes let you customize script behavior directly in the Inspector without changing code.
- **Rapid Iteration** — Hot Reloading lets you see code changes in real-time without restarting your app.
- **Seamless Integration** — The Editor bridges the gap between your code and your scene, making it easy to connect scripts to Entities and Components.
