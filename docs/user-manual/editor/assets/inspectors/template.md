A Template (also called a Prefab) is an asset that contains a piece of an Entity hierarchy. It has a root Entity and can have any number of children. A Template is a reusable Entity that you can instantiate dynamically at runtime or place multiple instances of it in your Scene. When you change the Template asset, all instances of the Template will also change.

For more information about working with Templates, see [Templates](/user-manual/editor/templates/).

## Inspector

{/*![Template Asset Inspector](/img/user-manual/editor/assets/inspectors/asset-inspector-template.png)*/}

The Template asset inspector displays an interactive 3D preview of the Template's entity hierarchy. You can rotate the preview by clicking and dragging.

## Properties

This asset type has no configurable properties in the Inspector. It provides a visual preview only.
