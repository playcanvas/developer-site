title: JSON
---

[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

In PlayCanvas, JSON assets are used to store various types of structured data. Some example use cases are:

- Configuration files
- Data for procedural generation
- Storing game settings
- Level design data

## Inspector

![JSON Asset Inspector](/img/user-manual/editor/assets/inspectors/asset-inspector-json.png)

The JSON asset inspector displays a formatted preview of the JSON data contained in the asset.

## Properties

This asset type has no configurable properties in the Inspector. It displays a read-only preview of the JSON data with syntax formatting.
