The effects created in Shader Editor are a combination of [Graphs](/shader-editor/overview/graphs) and their [Nodes](/shader-editor/overview/nodes), [Materials](/shader-editor/overview/materials) and [Textures](/shader-editor/overview/textures).

Each of these is explained along with information on the relationship between them.

In this section you can also read more about [File Handling](/shader-editor/overview/file-handling) and some notes on the general [Workflow](/shader-editor/overview/workflow).
