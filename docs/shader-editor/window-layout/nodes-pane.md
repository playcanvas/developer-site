![Nodes Pane](/images/shader-editor/nodes-pane.png)

The Nodes Pane lists the built-in nodes available for constructing graphs. Nodes are grouped into sub-sections by category.

At the top of the pane are controls for filtering the list of nodes:

| Control      | Use                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| I            | Toggle to show only input nodes.          |
| X            | Toggle to show only transform nodes.      |
| O            | Toggle to show only output nodes.         |
| Filter Entry | Filter the list of nodes further by name. |

For more information on using the Nodes Pane to create nodes, see the [Graph Editor][2] documentation.
